Programming Background:
I've taken about one year and a half of introduction to programming courses in my local community college.  I'm familiar
with C++ and Java.  I'm really interested in web development and hope to someday become a web developer.

My favorite program in CS 165 was the final project where we made our own entire program and I made a course
